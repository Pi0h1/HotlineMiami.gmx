I call this build the "Decadence Build" 
due to it ending in an almost demo-esc manner on Decadence.

This is the only build i had to Decompile to get the source.

A patched version with an Different Audio Dll is included as 
CocaineCowboy(audio_patch).exe,
the only difference is that it uses a different audio extension
with music from the audio_patch folder, wich are .ogg's.

the normal EXE uses SXMS, wich sucks, is slow, and sounds distorted!
