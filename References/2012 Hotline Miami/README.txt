Hotline Miami 1.1
.................
Please run the game in a resolution with a width of at least
1280 and 768 in height. 1024 x 768 may work, but could result 
in problems. 1280 x 768 is the preferred resolution.
...........................
If you get an error saying "Error defining external function"
please install the file in the "folder redist" and then
restart your computer.
......................
If your game doesn't load or you get an error message saying
"Game data failed to load. Game file seems corrupt." Try
disabling your printer as that might be the root of the 
problem. It's weird, but has been reported to be the cause
of the problem.
...............
If the game starts to show slowdown while playing, it may
be the result of having a wireless mouse connected. Try
playing the game using a wired mouse instead.
.................
If you are not able to move between floors in certain levels
change your resolution to at least 1200 x 768.
..............................................
If the game shows signs of slowdown after using and then
disabling 360 control support, please restart your computer
and run the game again.
.......................
Sorry for any and all inconveniences!
