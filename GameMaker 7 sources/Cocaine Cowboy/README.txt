This is the build Nigel Lowrie played.

Since i only had the gmk, songs and DLL's i had to manually compile it.

A patched version with an Different Audio Dll is included as 
CocaineCowboy(audio_patch).exe,
the only difference is that it uses a different audio extension
with music from the audio_patch folder, wich are .ogg's.

the normal EXE uses SXMS, wich sucks, is slow, and sounds distorted!
