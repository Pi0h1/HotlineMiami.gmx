# Super Carnage

Developed by Jonatan Söderström; this project was originally released on an old Game Maker community forum around 2004 intended as a top-down-shooter engine for the community to check out.
This repository is based on a 2006 revision of Super Carnage.

### Notes:
- Super Carnage served as a prototype for what would later become Hotline Miami.

- It has been reported that GameMaker users at the time used this project to create their own games but sadly none have been re-discovered in recent years.

- Super Carnage was considered lost for years until reddit user [/u/cars2forthegba](https://old.reddit.com/r/HotlineMiami/comments/cahjbb/not_sure_if_anyone_found_this_before_but_heres/ "/u/cars2forthegba") found it in 2019.

- The project file was in a .gm6 format intended to be read by Game Maker 6.
- That file was opened with Game Maker 7.0, from there ported to GameMaker: Studio 1.4 and from there to GameMaker Studio 2.3
